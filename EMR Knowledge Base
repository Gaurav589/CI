 **EMR Terminologies**

**Instance fleet :** 

The collection of EC2 instances that host each node type is called either an instance fleet
The instance fleets or uniform instance groups configuration is a choice you make when you create a cluster.
It applies to all node types, and it can't be changed later.
The instance fleets configuration offers the widest variety of provisioning options for EC2 instances. 
Each node type has a single instance fleet, and the task instance fleet is optional. 
For each instance fleet, you specify up to five instance types, which can be provisioned as On-Demand and Spot Instanc

**Master Node :**
The master node manages the cluster and typically runs master components of distributed applications.

**Core Nodes :** 

Core nodes are managed by the master node. 
Core nodes run the Data Node daemon to coordinate data storage as part of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). 
They also run the Task Tracker daemon and perform other parallel computation tasks on data that installed applications require.

**Task Nodes :**

Task nodes are optional. You can use them to add power to perform parallel computation tasks on data, 
such as Hadoop MapReduce tasks and Spark executors.Task nodes don't run the Data Node daemon, nor do they store data in HDFS
